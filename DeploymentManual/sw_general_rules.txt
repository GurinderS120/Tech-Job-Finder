GITHUB REVIEW
If you wish to push any changes onto the main branch, you will need to pull the requests with at least 1 approved review.

The other rules I cannot find a way to have github enforce, so please try your best you implement them properly.

GITHUB COMMIT MESSAGES
Commit messages should be a short summary in proper English about what was done, for example:
git commit -m "Fixed the home button on navbar."

GITHUB BRANCH NAMING CONVENTION
We will have a naming convention for our branches as follows:
<branch author initials>_<branch purpose>_<change summary>
example purposes would include:
bug = bug fixes
wip = work in progress
feat = adding/removing features
So for example sw_bugfix_home if I were to fix a bug on the home page. Please keep everything lower case. (snake case)

If we make a branch that doesn't necessarily belong to a specific author, omit the branch author initials:
<branch purpose>_<change summary>
for example: bugfix_home

FILES NAMING CONVENTION
<author initials>_<short description(in snake case)>
File names should be short and descriptive, < 25 characters.
AVOID any special characters.
Example:
sw_home_page
If we make any content that doesn't necessarily belong to a specific author, omit the branch author initials. See GITHUB BRANCH NAMING CONVENTION for examples.

VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTION
We should ALWAYS use meaningful variable names, and we should use snake case.
Snake case is defined as: Style of writing in which each space is replaced by an underscore(_) and the first letter of each word is lower case.
Examples:
user_id
home_button
email
